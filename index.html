                    What is LARP?

                Live Action Role-play, or LARP, is a role playing game style similar to table top rpg's such as Dungeons
                and Dragons,
                but instead of using dice and sitting at a table, players dress up as their characters and use foam
                props to play.
                There are many different games within the LARP umbrella, each with their own community and rules. Its a
                great way to have some nerdy fun
                and have a community of friends.

                <strong>
                    Why foam props?
                </strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Since players in LARP games usually engage in physical simulated combat, it's important for them to do
                so safely.
                The last thing anyone wants is to get hurt. With that in mind LARP props, especially weapons, are
                typically constructed from foam
                around a fiberglass core. This way most injury's will be mitigated by the soft props, ensuring a safe,
                and fun adventure.

                    What should I wear for LARP?

            </dt>
            <dd>
                The costuming you need depends largely on the game your are looking to join. There are LARP games in
                most any setting, whether it be classic fantasy,
                post apocalyptic, western, steampunk or victorian, or anything imaginable. We at Live Action Roleplay
                Props llc try to cater to various styles and settings,
                but its best to check with your local game to see what they require for costuming and weapons.
